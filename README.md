# Parzen_classifier
This project focuses on wine quality classification using Parzen window methods in Python with NumPy and Matplotlib. 
Key tasks include data preprocessing, implementing discrete and continuous Parzen windows, parameter optimization, and error rate analysis. 
The project splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, selects optimal parameters, and evaluates classification performance.
